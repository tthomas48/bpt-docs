# What is a Season Pass?
A season pass is what we normally think of in theatre. Each season pass entitles the holder to one ticket to one performance of each production in the season.

## How do I get started?
First you need to [enable passes](enable.md). It's disabled by default. 

Once that's done you'll have a link for Passes in your Menu bar.

* Click on Passes
* Click on Add Pass 
* Fill in the fields and chose Season Pass
* Click Save Changes

## How do I specify which productions are eligible?
BuyPlayTix needs to know what productions a pass is good for. So after you create a production you'll need to go in and add it to each pass.

* Click on Passes
* Click on Assign Productions
* Chose the pass you want to assign in the top drop down
* Drag eligible productions from the left to right
