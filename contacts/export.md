## Export Contacts

Once you've setup a mailing list provider in *Contact Settings* your contacts will automatically be exported. But if you need to add any contacts from before you configured your mailing list provider you can do so easily.

* Click on *Contacts*
* Click on *Export Contacts*
* Click the *Export to Provider* button

It may take a while, but all you contacts will be exported.
