# What is a Punch Pass?
A punch pass is a pass with a limited number of uses. If you bought a six punch pass you could redeem it for six tickets over the course of a season. Whether six tickets for a single show, or one ticket for six shows.

## How do I get started?
First you need to [enable passes](enable.md). It's disabled by default. 

Once that's done you'll have a link for Passes in your Menu bar.

* Click on Passes
* Click on Add Pass 
* Fill in the fields and choose Punchcard Pass
* Add the number of Punches. 
* Click Save Changes

## How do I specify which productions are eligible?
BuyPlayTix needs to know what productions a pass is good for. So after you create a production you'll need to go in and add it to each pass.

* Click on Passes
* Click on Assign Productions
* Chose the pass you want to assign in the top drop down
* Drag eligible productions from the left to right

## How do I record a person who uses the pass in person?
While you can use BuyPlayTix's box office to record walkups using the pass, many theaters still use pencil and paper to record reservations. To record a walk-up pass user after the show.

* Click on Passes
* Select the pass used.
* Click on Pass holders
* Click on the Gear next to the Pass holder's name
* Click on Punch Pass
* Chose the number of tickets redeemed
* Click Ok
